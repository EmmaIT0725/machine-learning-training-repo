# Personal Machine Learning Study Space

Welcome to my personal machine learning study space! This repository serves as my dedicated environment for learning, experimenting, and honing my skills in the field of machine learning.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide me with a structured and organized environment for studying machine learning concepts, algorithms, and applications. It's my space to explore different datasets, build and train models, and document my learnings along the way.

## Contents

- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation and analysis.
- **Scripts:** Stores Python scripts for implementing various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- **Datasets:** Contains datasets used for training, validation, and testing, which are accessible from the data folder. Additionally, Python-provided datasets can also be utilized.
- **Models:** Stores trained machine learning models for reference and further experimentation.
- **Resources:** Includes helpful resources, tutorials, articles, and references related to machine learning.

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository as your own personal playground for machine learning. Experiment with different algorithms, datasets, and methodologies. Document your findings, insights, and experiments to track your progress and learning journey.
